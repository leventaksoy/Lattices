In this repository, algorithms developed for the realization of logic functions using switching lattices and logic functions used as benchmarks can be found. There exist three algorithms, namely JANUS, MEDEA, and MF_TOOL. 

JANUS is an approximate algorithm that aims to find the realization of a logic function on a switching lattice including a number of four-terminal switches close to the minimum. 

MEDEA is a divide and conquer method used to find a realization of a single logic function on a switching lattice using a little computational effort. 

MF_TOOL can realize the multiple functions in a single lattice using the solutions of JANUS or MEDEA on each single logic function.

The detailed explanation of these algorithms is given in the README file.
